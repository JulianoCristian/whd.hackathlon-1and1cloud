# 1&1 Cloud API Management Console
We ([Daniel Dimitrov](https://twitter.com/compojoom) & [Alejandro Martinez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandromartcu) have 
created this Universal Windows App (UWP) at the WHD.hackathlon 2016. 

The App is working with the [1&1 Cloud API v1](https://cloudpanel-api.1and1.com/documentation/v1/)
and is able to:

* list the servers, load balancers and firewall policies in your 1&1 Cloud account.
* Create a basic Cent OS Server 
* Delete a server

To use the app you need to have a working internet connection and you have to 
provide a correct API key. (the app currently isn't published in the Windows App store, so you'll have to build it from source on
your machine)

# Building the App
Install Visual Studio 2015 and import the project in it. After that run the build.

# Tools used
- Visual Studio
- Angular.js
- Bootstrap CSS
